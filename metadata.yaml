description: A master of drinking, whoring, theft - and escape! While Jack Sheppard
  seems marked from birth for a terrible end, his wit and charm might just be able
  to cheat fate. Fate, however, seems eager to cheat him out of an honest living,
  when Jack begins visiting the notorious Black Lion, drinking den of the worst criminals
  in London. Soon he is one of the most famous scoundrels in the city - not for his
  crimes, but for the wonderful fact that not one of the King's fine prisons can hold
  him. But Jack's luck will have to run out eventually...
